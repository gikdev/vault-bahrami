# My Planning method

## 1. Capture / Log

* Write everything in daily log (thoughts, tasks, events...).

* Ask: Actionable?
  * Yes → define task
  * No → note for reference

---

## 2. Task Definition

* Format:

  ```
  + -> project
  @ -> context
  ~ -> time
  # -> tag
  $ -> energy
  * -> is important
  ! -> is urgent

  [urgency][importance] Title @context ~time $energy +project #tag
  ```

* Assign deadline / calendar block.

---

## 3. Prioritize / Sort

* Sort Main list by:
  - `@Context`
  - `~Time` & `$Energy`
  - `! urgent` & `* important`

---

## 4. Execution

* Follow Pomodoro cycles (25–50 min work + 5–10 min rest)

---

## 5. Review

* Daily: mark completed, update lists, adjust tomorrow’s plan
* Weekly: clean lists, check Someday/Maybe, re-prioritize, adjust calendar

---

## Tools

* Notebook + Pen → daily log
* Timer → Pomodoro
* Calendar (Google Cal) → deadlines & time blocks
* Lists: Main, Someday/Maybe, Waiting For
