I was standing and leaning slightly back against a radiator to get warm; it is located exactly in the front of the kitchen. I was wearing my normal in-house clothes. The TV on the right side was on, but I wasn’t really paying attention to what was playing—it felt like background noise while my mind focused elsewhere.

Then the doorbell rang. Someone opened the door—I’m not sure if it was from the inside or outside—but a girl ran in and hugged me. She was shorter than me and wearing a Chador, so I couldn’t see her hair. She buried her face in my chest, and her face was really cold, which made me realize it was winter. Somehow, I knew she was my wife, though I had never actually met her before. The hug happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to remember her face, and I was left surprised and overwhelmed by the sudden closeness. I also noticed someone else at the door, maybe a parent or an older figure, who had a key—adding a sense of familial presence or social awareness.

The lights from the windows were low, suggesting early morning, late afternoon, or cloudy weather. Our curtains blocked the view outside. Only the kitchen lamp was on; other lamps in the house were off, so I assumed others were asleep. The combination of warmth from the radiator, the quiet house, and the sudden hug gave the moment an intense, almost dreamlike intimacy—a feeling of connection I hadn’t experienced before.
