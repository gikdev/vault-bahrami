## 🟢 **1. Bullet Journal (BuJo)**

**Invented by:** Ryder Carroll  
**Goal:** To bring clarity, mindfulness, and structure using pen and paper.  
**Core idea:** One notebook becomes your _everything system_ — to-dos, notes, ideas, reflections, and tracking.  
**Main tools:**

- **Bullets:**  
    • Task (`•`)  
    ○ Event  
    – Note
    
- **Collections:** Themed pages (e.g. “Books to Read”, “Ideas”, “Goals 2025”).
- **Future/Monthly/Daily Logs:**
    - Future → long-term planning
    - Monthly → overview
    - Daily → tasks, notes, events

**Solves:**

- Mental clutter (by capturing all thoughts)
- Lack of reflection (you regularly migrate unfinished tasks)
- Overcomplex systems (keeps it analog and personal)

**Best for:** Visual thinkers, reflective personalities, or anyone who likes journaling and minimal tech.

## 🔵 **2. GTD (Getting Things Done)**

**Invented by:** David Allen  
**Goal:** To help you _capture and organize everything_, so your brain can relax and focus.  
**Core idea:** “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”

**Five steps:**

1. **Capture:** Write down every task, idea, or reminder (your “inbox”).
2. **Clarify:** Decide what each thing means — is it actionable? If yes, what’s the _next step_?
3. **Organize:** Put things into lists (Next Actions, Projects, Waiting For, Someday).
4. **Reflect:** Review weekly — clean up, reprioritize.
5. **Engage:** Choose tasks based on context, time, and energy.

**Solves:**

- Mental overload
- Forgetting tasks
- Lack of clarity about next steps

**Best for:** Busy professionals, multitaskers, or anyone juggling several projects (e.g. developers, managers, students).

## 🟣 **3. Home-Loaded RAM / Offloading System**

**Goal:** Prevent “mental RAM overload.”  
**Core idea:** The brain gets tired when you hold too many “open loops” — half-finished or unrecorded tasks.  
**Method:**

- Whenever something crosses your mind (idea, worry, task), _immediately write it down_ somewhere trusted.
- Review those notes later and organize them.

**Solves:**
- Anxiety caused by remembering too much.
- Poor focus during deep work.

**Best for:** Overthinkers or anyone whose mind constantly jumps between unfinished things.

## 🟠 **4. Time Blocking**

**Popularized by:** Cal Newport  
**Goal:** To control your day by _assigning time to every important activity._  
**Core idea:**

- Divide your day into fixed blocks of time.
- Each block has a specific task or type of task.
- Treat it like an appointment — no overlap.

**Example:**

|Time|Task|
|---|---|
|9–11|Coding|
|11–11:30|Break|
|11:30–13|Design review|
|14–15|Emails & meetings|
|15–17|Learning / Project work|

**Solves:**
- Wasting time on unplanned work
- Multitasking and distractions
- Feeling “busy but not productive”

**Best for:** People who love structure (especially ISTJs!), freelancers, students, or deep workers.

## 🔴 **5. Prioritization / Ordering by Importance**

There are a few well-known sub-methods:

### a) **Eisenhower Matrix**

- Divide tasks into 4 quadrants:  
    1️⃣ Urgent + Important → Do now  
    2️⃣ Not Urgent + Important → Plan it  
    3️⃣ Urgent + Not Important → Delegate  
    4️⃣ Not Urgent + Not Important → Delete

**Goal:** Focus on what truly matters long-term, not just what’s shouting for attention.

### b) **Ivy Lee Method**

- At the end of each day, list your **top 6 tasks** for tomorrow.
- Rank them by importance.
- Next day, work only on #1 until it’s done, then move to #2.

**Goal:** Simplify focus and ensure high-priority work actually happens.

**Solves:**
- Doing low-value work first
- Feeling busy but unproductive

**Best for:** People who want simplicity and daily clarity.
