## 🌅 1. **Morning Setup — Direct Your Energy**

**Goal:** Start the day with clarity and structure.  
**Time:** 10–15 minutes.

1. **Review your priorities (Eisenhower or Ivy Lee):**
    - Look at your weekly goals or yesterday’s reflection.
    - Choose **3–6 key tasks** for today, ranked by importance.
	
2. **Time-block your day:**
    - Assign blocks for deep work, meetings, rest, and learning.
    - Example:
        ```
        09:00–11:00 Deep work (Project A)
        11:00–11:30 Break
        11:30–13:00 Frontend development
        14:00–15:00 Review & small tasks
        15:00–17:00 Learning / Skill building
        ```
		
3. **Log it in your Bullet Journal’s Daily Log**
    - Write the date, your schedule, and the top tasks.
    - Add a motivating sentence or “intention” for the day (e.g. _“Focus on quality, not speed.”_)

## 🔵 2. **During Work — Stay Focused, Stay Clear**

**Goal:** Work deeply while capturing distractions and preserving mental RAM.

1. **Work in Pomodoro cycles (25–50 min blocks)**
    - Choose one task per session.
    - After each block, take a 5–10 minute break.
	
2. **If something pops into your mind**
    - Don’t stop what you’re doing.
    - Write it quickly in your **GTD Inbox**, which is your **BuJo Daily Log’s margin or corner.**
    - Example:
        ```
        → Email Ali about design review
        → Add “Book: Deep Work” to reading list
        → Idea: Create a reusable table component
        ```

3. **Keep an “Open Loop Capture” habit**
    - Anything that’s not urgent but distracts you → capture it, not do it.

## 🟣 3. **Midday or Between Blocks — Quick Reality Check**

**Goal:** Make sure you’re on track.  
**Time:** 5 minutes.

Ask:

- Am I working on what matters most?
- Do I need to adjust any time blocks?
- Is my energy low — should I take a short reset?

If yes, shift blocks — but keep structure intact.

## 🌇 4. **End of Day — Reflection & Cleanup**

**Goal:** Clear mental RAM and close the feedback loop.  
**Time:** 10–15 minutes.

1. **Process your Inbox (GTD style):**
    - For each note in your “inbox”:
        - If it takes <2 min → do it now.
        - If longer → move it to a _Project_, _Next Action_, or _Someday_ collection in your BuJo.
            
2. **Reflect briefly:**
    - What went well today?
    - What blocked me?
    - What one thing can I improve tomorrow?
	
3. **Plan tomorrow:**
    - Migrate incomplete tasks.
    - Choose top 3–6 priorities for tomorrow (Ivy Lee method).
    - Optional: Pre-draw your next day’s schedule.

## 🧠 5. **Weekly Review — Keep It Aligned**

**Goal:** Stay connected to bigger goals.

- Reset your Bullet Journal’s **Weekly Log** (focus, intentions, priorities).
- Adjust your time-block templates for next week.

---

## ⚙️ 6. **Optional Add-Ons**
