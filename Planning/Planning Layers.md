## 🧱 **Layer 1 — Core Values (The “Why”)**

**Purpose:** Define _what truly matters_ to you.  
This is the foundation — all decisions and goals flow from here.

**Questions to clarify:**

- What principles define a good life for me?
- What kind of person do I want to become?
- What values guide my choices (e.g. mastery, contribution, honesty, peace)?


**Typical tools:**

- Reflection journaling
- Personal mission statement
- Value clarification exercises

> 🧠 Without this layer, every other layer risks misalignment — you might be productive, but not fulfilled.

---

### 🎯 **Layer 2 — Vision & Long-Term Goals (The “What”)**

**Purpose:** Translate values into a picture of the future.  
This is your _strategic direction_ — the “north star.”

**Questions to clarify:**

- What do I want to achieve in 1–5 years?
- What would a meaningful life/work look like?
- What’s my definition of success?

**Typical tools:**

- Vision board
- OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)
- SMART goals
- Life categories (career, health, relationships, learning, etc.)

---

### 🧭 **Layer 3 — Strategy & Medium-Term Planning (The “How”)**

**Purpose:** Create systems that move your goals forward.  
This connects **vision** with **daily action**.

**Questions:**
- What ongoing projects support my long-term goals?
- What habits or skills do I need to build?
- How do I measure progress?

**Typical tools:**
- GTD _Projects_ and _Next Actions_ lists
- Quarterly or monthly planning
- Habit trackers
- Review systems (weekly, monthly)

> 🧩 GTD mainly operates here — it manages commitments and workflows.

---

### 🗓️ **Layer 4 — Tactical / Daily Planning (The “When”)**

**Purpose:** Manage time, focus, and energy day-to-day.

**Questions:**

- What will I do today, and when?
- What are my top priorities?
- How can I structure my time to support focus and balance?

**Typical tools:**

- **Time Blocking** (structuring your day)
- **Bullet Journal Daily Log** (task management)
- **Ivy Lee / Eisenhower Matrix** (prioritization)
- **Pomodoro** (focus & execution)

> 🧠 This is where _productivity_ lives — but it depends on the higher layers for meaning.

---

### 🕹️ **Layer 5 — Focus & Execution (The “Now”)**

**Purpose:** Handle the _moment-to-moment_ experience of working.

**Questions:**

- How do I maintain focus and flow?
- What do I do when distractions or ideas pop up?

**Typical tools:**

- **Pomodoro** or **Deep Work** sessions
- **Inbox Capture** (GTD or Bullet Journal margin)
- **Mindfulness / single-tasking**
- **Energy tracking** (knowing when you’re sharpest)

> 🔄 Here’s where your “mental RAM” system shines — catching distractions without breaking focus.

---

### 🔄 **Layer 6 — Reflection & Feedback (The “Learn & Adapt”)**

**Purpose:** Improve the system continuously.  
Each week, reflect on what’s working and what’s not.

**Questions:**
- What went well this week?
- What felt out of alignment with my values?
- What patterns do I see?

**Typical tools:**
- Bullet Journal _Weekly Review_
- GTD _Review step_
- Journaling prompts
- Metrics & scoreboards (optional)

> 🧠 This layer ensures learning and adaptation — turning your system into a living, evolving process.

### 🔧 How the Methods Fit Together

- **Values →** give purpose to **Goals**
- **Goals →** break into **Projects/Strategies** (GTD)
- **Projects →** break into **Daily Plans** (BuJo + Time Blocking)
- **Plans →** executed using **Pomodoro + Capture**
- **Execution →** improved via **Reflection**

So it’s like a **pipeline**:  
**Values → Vision → Strategy → Planning → Action → Reflection → back to Values.**
