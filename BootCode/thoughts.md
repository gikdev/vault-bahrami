# **Solopreneur Teaching / Learning Project – Summary & Action Plan**

## **1. Your Core Idea**

* You want to help beginners **learn coding efficiently** by:

  * Curating a **clear path** of lessons
  * Giving **projects and exercises** at key points
  * Providing **feedback** (manually for now)
  * Teaching **practical skills first**, theory optionally
* You aim to **avoid overloading** beginners with unnecessary content.
* Your MVP platform is ready:

  * Built with Angular + .NET
  * Single `Lessons` table with title, content, position
  * Multi-format: text, video, audio
  * Ordered lessons → linear, easy to follow
* MVP purpose: **validate teaching idea**, not become a SaaS.
* Optional features (authentication, payments, chat, exercise submission) are **future enhancements**, not needed for early validation.

---

## **2. Constraints & Leverages**

**Time / Lifestyle**

* 5–10 hours/week
* Work mostly at night
* Uni + dev job → limited availability

**Resources**

* Laptop, phone, internet
* Skills: coding, English, productivity, learning
* CMS, servers, business management apps

**Challenges / Limitations**

* Camera shy → prefer text/podcast
* Not confident with non-technical skills (teamwork, communication)
* Perfectionist & sometimes lazy/procrastinating
* Sanctions in Iran → limited access to some courses/resources
* English may be a barrier for learners

**Leverage**

* Teaching experience / love for teaching
* Developer mindset → structured thinking
* Experience breaking and building projects → real examples
* Ability to curate content & provide selective guidance

---

## **3. Teaching Philosophy**

* Teach **mental models first**: “Why does this exist?” → “How to use it?” → “What to ignore.”
* Only teach **what you’ve personally used** to build something.
* For advanced/rare concepts:

  * Mention briefly
  * Provide **links to docs or references**
  * Allow learners to skip safely
* Focus on **core, practical skills**:

  * HTML, CSS, JS basics
  * Functions, classes, variables, imports/exports
  * Small projects & exercises
* Give **clear milestones**:

  * Each 2–3 lessons → one small project
  * Outcome-based learning (deployment, interactive feature, readable page)
* Encourage **error-driven learning**:

  * Break things intentionally → read errors → fix → remember
  * Normalize failure → confidence through mistakes
* Introduce **doc-reading skill**:

  * Beginners must learn to find answers in documentation & online
  * Provide curated references for optional exploration

## **4. Suggested Curriculum / Lesson Structure (MVP)**

### **Phase 0 – Orientation**

1. Start Here: How to Use This Path
2. What Programming Actually Is (No Hype)
3. How Developers Learn (Docs, Google, AI)

### **Phase 1 – Computer & Web Basics**

4. Files, Folders, Programs (practical skills)
5. What the Internet & Web Are
6. What HTML Is and Why It Exists

### **Phase 2 – HTML (Minimal & Practical)**

7. Core HTML Tags You’ll Use Daily
8. HTML Tags You Should Know Exist (But Not Memorize)
9. How to Read HTML Documentation

* **Mini Project:** Personal static page

### **Phase 3 – CSS (Taste over Tricks)**

10. What CSS Is Responsible For
11. Core CSS Concepts (Layout, Text, Color)
12. Making Something Look Acceptable (Not Fancy)

* **Mini Project:** Improve your personal page

### **Phase 4 – JavaScript (Foundations Only)**

13. Why JavaScript Exists
14. Variables, Functions, and Logic
15. Making the Page Do One Simple Thing

* **Mini Project:** Small interaction (button, form, etc.)

### **Phase 5 – Deployment & Reality**

16. What “Deploying” Means
17. Putting Your Site Online
18. What to Learn Next (and What NOT to Rush)

## **5. Teaching / Validation Guidelines**

* **Validation > Monetization**: focus on checking if learners complete lessons & projects.
* Early validation can be done with:

  * 1 serious beginner (high signal)
  * 2–3 friends/peers (different ages)
  * 1 senior reviewer (teacher/PM) for subtractive feedback
* **Metrics for success**:

  * Lessons completed
  * Projects built
  * Learner can explain what they learned
* Feedback and communication:

  * Use existing tools (Telegram, Eitaa, GitHub, Google Docs)
  * Avoid building chat/exercise submission features yet

---

## **6. Handling Non-English Learners**

* Teach in Persian (your native language)
* Reference English docs only briefly, with clear instructions

  * Highlight “sections to read” and “sections to ignore”
* Teach **developer English skills**:

  * Recognize keywords in errors
  * Scan docs for examples
  * Google/AI for answers
* Optional lesson: “How to Learn Programming Without Being Fluent in English”

---

## **7. Confidence & Scope Management**

* **Do not attempt to teach everything** → focus on what is essential and practical.
* Confidence rule:

> “I only teach what I’ve personally used to build something.”

* Rare/advanced topics → mention + defer to docs
* Errors are **part of learning**, normalize them in your teaching
* Focus on **sequence and structure** > deep perfection of content
* Keep lessons short & digestible → text first, optional audio, optional video

---

## **8. Exercises / Projects Guidelines**

* Every 2–3 lessons → one visible mini-project
* Projects reinforce lessons, encourage experimentation
* Example exercises:

  * Remove closing tag → observe behavior
  * Change case / rename files → see effect
  * Build one small interactive feature
* Emphasize **deliberate failure & fixing** → builds confidence

---

## **9. Immediate Next Steps**

1. Write **titles for all lessons** (Phase 0 → Phase 2 as start)
2. Identify **where exercises/projects fit** naturally
3. Start **writing short lessons** (text first)
4. Include **references for optional exploration**
5. Test with **1–3 learners** to validate flow
6. Collect feedback → adjust sequence/content
7. Optional: Write **“How to Learn Programming”** lesson to normalize breaking things and reading docs

---

## **10. Optional Resources / Links**

* **Learning by doing / deliberate practice**:

  * [Productive Failure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_failure)
  * [Deliberate Practice (Anders Ericsson)](https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice/)
* **HTML / CSS references for students**:

  * [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
  * [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* **Free JS tutorials**:

  * [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
  * [MDN JS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* MVP is enough → deploy and start teaching.
* Teach **core + sequence**; reference docs for extras.
* Encourage **breaking things & learning from errors**.
* Validation is done with **small, real learners**, not audience size.
* Confidence comes from **scope control** and real experience, not knowing everything.
* Focus on **practical results** over perfection or completeness.
