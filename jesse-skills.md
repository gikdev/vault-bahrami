### **📝 Helpful Info & Mindset Reminders**

*   **The "Gap":** The pain you feel now is the "Gap." It is the space between who you are today and who you want to be. Use the pain as fuel, not as a reason to quit.
*   **Solo Level:** You are currently playing the "Tutorial" or "Solo Level." It is supposed to be quiet. It is supposed to be about preparation. Don't rush to the "Boss Fight" (marriage/responsibility) before you have leveled up your skills.
*   **ISTJ Superpower:** You are organized, logical, and dutiful. The world needs people who can actually keep things running. Lean into your nature; don't fight it.
*   **Dua (Prayer):** In the Islamic worldview, skills are the means, but success (Tawfiq) comes from Allah. Combine your effort with sincere prayer (Dua) for a righteous companion and a clear path.

*"Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves."* (Quran 13:11)

### **۱. How to Present the "Petra" Concept**
You don't need to explain the entire plot of *Minecraft: Story Mode*. Just focus on the **dynamic** between the characters.

**Say something like this:**
> "I want to explain my loneliness using a metaphor from a video game I played. There are two characters, Jesse and Petra. They have a bond where they are completely in sync—they face life-threatening danger together, they understand each other without words, and they are loyal to the end.
>
> My problem isn't just that I want a girlfriend. I am looking for that specific **depth of connection**—a 'partner in crime' who is with me for the adventure of life, not just someone to live in a house with. I feel like I am stuck in 'single-player mode' while desperately craving that 'co-op' experience."

### **۲. How to Explain Your "Problem"**
You need to explain the **contrast** you feel between the game and reality.

**Say something like this:**
> "The issue is that experiencing that story made my real life feel gray and lonely by comparison. When I finished the game, I felt a profound sense of grief, as if I had lost real friends.
>
> I am a ۱۹-year-old student in Iran. I have constraints—I can't date, and my university is all-boys. I know I have to wait for marriage to find a partner, but the wait feels unbearable because I crave that level of connection *now*. I feel like I'm in a holding pattern, and I'm worried I'll never find that kind of bond in real life."
